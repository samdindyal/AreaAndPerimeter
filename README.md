# AreaAndPerimeter

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purose of this assignment was to, given dimensions was user inputs, calculate and display the perimeter and area of a circle, square or rectangle.

In this implementation I have decided to represent the shapes graphically using the UIBezierPath object to draw them on the screen and UISegmentedControl to allow the user to switch between shapes. Calculations and display updates are performed dynamically with user input.
